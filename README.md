**Welcome to my portfolio!**

## Introduction

This is the official open source repository of my website. It is build on the latest technologies, trying to put together as much of what I have learnt over the years intro practice.

The website features a variety of tidbits from across the web, from how the server is set up to the animations on the page. This README.md serves as a feature list as to what all has made this website special, and a proof of source for anyone else to fork and work on their own version of the website (with due credits, of course).

## Visit the Website

## Building from Source

Since the project has been set up with Gatsby, the build process has become easier than ever.
**Just follow the steps to get started:**

1. Make sure you have Node/NPM installed on your computer, then run the following commands:

```console
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

2. Clone the repository and go into the working directory

```console
git clone https://github.com/sgcuber24/portfolio-gatsby.git
cd portfolio-gatsby
```

3. Then, just run this command to install the necessary dependencies.

```console
npm install
```

4. Watch the project come to life by firing up a server.

```console
gatsby develop
```

5. If you want to build the application in production, just make use of `gatsby-cli` again

```console
gatsby build
```
